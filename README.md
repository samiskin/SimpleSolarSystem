# Simple Solar System
A simple simulation of the solar system, progressing at 60 days per second starting from August 20th 1997.  

The scale of the planets are accurate relative to each other and the planet's orbits are also accurate, however the distance scale and planet size scale are different (so even if earth and venus might look so close together that they are touching, the distance between them is much larger than the radii would make it seem)
